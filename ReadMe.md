# Rush Hour Shift

### How to Play

Open command prompt in the Rush Hour Shift folder and run the python script Rush_Hour.py
It is best to have the command prompt window and the pygame window side by side when playing.


If a user wants to see different agents play, lines 30 and 31 in entityManager.py needs to be changed. The second number in those lines represents what kind of a agent is created. Numbers represent a different agent:
1 = Human Player
2 = Best Search First
4 = Random agent
5 = A




###### Human player

To move the cars when playing Rush Hour Shift the player types into the command prompt window which car he wants to move, the direction of the car (N,E,W,S) and how far that car should move, respectively and seperated by spaces. 
Example, if the input from the command line is: '4 e 1' car number 4 will move 1 step to the east (right).
